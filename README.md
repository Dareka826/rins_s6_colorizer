# Rin's s6 colorizer

A program which wraps s6-rc and colorizes its output for some eye-candy during system startup and shutdown.

With colors you can also more easily tell what's going on at a glance.

TODO:
[x] separate functionality into smaller functions
[x] add wrapper functionality if run as "s6-rc-color"
